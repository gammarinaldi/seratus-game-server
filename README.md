## Real-time Game Server with WebSockets and Node.js

This project provides a basic framework for building a real-time game server using WebSockets and Node.js. It allows clients (web browsers) to connect and exchange messages in real-time, enabling features like multiplayer gameplay, chat rooms, and live updates.

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

-   Node.js and npm installed ([https://nodejs.org/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://nodejs.org/))

**Installation:**

1.  Clone this repository:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/gammarinaldi/seratus-game-server.git
    
    ```
    

**Running the Server:**

1.  Start the server:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    node websocketServer.js
    
    ```
    
    This will typically start the server on port `8080` by default. You can customize the port by modifying the server code.
    
2.  Connect your client-side code (HTML/JavaScript) to the server at `ws://localhost:8080` (or your chosen port).
    

**Structure:**

-   `websocketServer.js`: Main server file that handles WebSocket connections and game logic.

**Features:** (**Note:** This is a basic framework, expand upon it for your game)

-   Handles WebSocket connections from clients.
-   Broadcasts messages to all connected clients.
-   Room management for separating players into different game instances.
-   Basic game logic for your specific game.

**Further Development:**

-   Implement game-specific logic and message handling in `websocketServer.js`.
-   Add client-side code for connecting to the server and handling messages.
-   Consider using a framework like Socket.IO for additional features.
-   Implement security measures for authentication and authorization.
